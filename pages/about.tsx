      <p>
        I&apos;m a brazilian software engineer, student and a writer. I&apos;m currently working as a
        fullstack developer. I love to write about my studies and thoughts, because I feel that
        I can learn more by doing so.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        In this website you will find articles written by me, and also a list of my favorite books and articles.
